The Python-based automatic particular seat grievance registration system facilitates the filing of complaints about
sitting in public or private settings. Users can report problems quickly with this method, and they will be documented right away for future adjustment.

Updations to be made further:
â€¢ For each seat, a QR Code would be allotted, which could be scanned in order to submit a complaint via the internet.
