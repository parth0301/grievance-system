# GrievanceForm
This is a basic Grievance form I made. although theres still some work pending. Due to database connection issues i have modified the code so as to store the data into a text file and save it to the local directory(Just A Temporary Solution. Still working on database linkage). Also attached some screenshots since the vercel hosted app wouldn't go past the data collection form without database linkage.
